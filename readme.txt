The image that I have included brings me great joy.
This is a drawing of Victor "Vector" Perkins from Despicable Me.
One day in Computer Architecture I was bored out of my mind so I drew this.
Professor Reiss was talking about vectors, which is what gave me the idea.
I did this in MS Paint with only my laptop's track pad.
